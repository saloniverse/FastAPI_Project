# Fast API Base Project
This project is a basic FastAPI application that sets up a simple REST API demonstarting useful capabilities like filtering, sorting, pagination to retreive server details from a mock database. It includes key components such as modular routing, dynamic query-based filtering, environment configuration, schema validation with Pydantic, and dependency management via Poetry. This API organized and manages server data in a straightforward way, making it suitable for building more structured applications with customizable data access.
